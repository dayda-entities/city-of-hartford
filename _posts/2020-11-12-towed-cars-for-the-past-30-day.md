This is a listing of the vehicles that were towed in the past 30 days and it is updated hourly. It shows vehicle information, license plate number, and where the vehicle was towed along with other information. When there is a large volume of towing in will take a while for the information to be updated. This data set does not include vehicles coded in the database as evidence, operator arrested, suspected stolen, or all holds.
