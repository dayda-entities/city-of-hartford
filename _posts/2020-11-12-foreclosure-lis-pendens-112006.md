Data is extracted from the City Clerk land record database on a monthly basis. The data is updated on the first work week of each month. Each foreclosure and lis pendens has multiple deeds filed for each transaction, we have summarized the documents to show only one record per property. Some properties we were unable to locate from the City Clerks records.
