There are more than 350 organizations in Hartford that provide family resources to our children, youth and adult populations. This directory is a comprehensive directory of these organizations, providing the name, contact information, location, mission, and type of family resources provided by each of these Hartford-based service providers. The list of resources has been organized into seven categories—civic engagement, youth & family enrichment, early childhood education & home daycare providers, workforce development, schools & higher education, support services, and government agencies—and is designed to help build a strong, vital community and improve the quality of life for each Hartford family.
